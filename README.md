## Setup
1. Clone the project: git clone https://github.com/eftelyabasakbayseckin/MajorAssignment12problem.git
2. Install the C++ compiler (for example, g++), the C++ compiler environment (for example, GCC), and the necessary dependencies required for the compilation process.

## Operating Instructions
There is a separate C++ file for each problem. At the beginning of each file are instructions for solving a specific problem.

Follow these steps to resolve any problems:
1. Open the relevant C++ file.
2. Compile the file: g++ PROBLEM#1 PROBLEM#1.cpp -o Problem 1 Greedy Algorithm.
3. Run the resulting executable: ./PROBLEM#1 Greedy Algorithm.
